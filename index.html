    <div class="col-md-6 col-12 pl-5 pt-3"> <p> DACA is short for Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals. DACA is a federal government program established by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 that allowed young people whose parents brought them to the United States illegally to be able to study, work, and support family in the US. DACA applicants were vetted for any criminal history, and if they passed and were accepted into the program, they could do basic things like get a license and apply for college or work permits.  The participants of this program are known as “Dreamers.” They need to have arrived in the US prior to turning 16. Many of them have been in this country practically their whole lives, so they wouldn’t be prepared to live anywhere else if they were to get deported.
